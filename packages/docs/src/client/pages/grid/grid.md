# Grid

### The Material Design responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.

The grid creates visual consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across a wide variety of designs. Material Designâ€™s responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout.

## How it works

## Spacing

The responsive grid focuses on consistent spacing widths, rather than column width. Material Design margins and columns follow an 8px square baseline grid. The spacing property is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive. By default, the spacing between two grid items follows a linear function: output(spacing) = spacing * 8px, e.g. spacing={2} creates a 16px wide gap.

This output transformation function can be customized using the theme.
